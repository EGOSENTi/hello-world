# hello-world

Wide awake and without a clue what to do.

God speaks many languages.

Religions are like badly written Linux distributions... 
Same kernel, many new ways to fuck it up.

Somebody please tell me what's going on.
I'm old enough to know. I want to help.

Where to go, what road to follow, who to love?
